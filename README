= Required, a utility to require all files in a directory

Required provides the ability to <b>require</b> all files within a
<b>d</b>irectory, with options for file inclusion/exclusion based on pattern
matching, as well as recursive descent. An array of all the files that were
loaded ('require' only loads a file the first time) are returned.

== Quick start

First pull in the 'required' module:
    require 'required'

To pull in all ruby files in a directory (this excludes subdirectories):
    required "some/path/to/dir"

Same as before, but require the files in reverse alphanumeric order:
    required "some/path/to/dir", :sort => lambda { |x, y| y <=> x}

To pull in files from multiple directories:
    required ["some/path/to/dir", "another/path/another/dir"]

Or to recurse through subdirectories, requiring all files along the way:
    required "lib", {:recurse => true}

Same as before, but exclude ruby files tagged as "_old":
    required "lib", {:recurse => true, :exclude => /_old/}
    # Will not require "lib/extensions/string_old.rb"

Same as before, but only require ruby files tagged with "_new":
    required "lib", {:recurse => true, :include => /_new/}

== Installing with RubyGems

A Gem of Required is available at gemcutter.org.  You can install it with:
    gem install required

== Running the tests

Testing Required requires the shoulda testing framework:
    gem install shoulda

There is one rake-based test task:
    rake test       runs all the tests

== Thanks

I would like to thank Ryan Wilcox for coming up with the initial idea and
implementation of a convenience method for requiring everything in a directory
for a project we work on.
