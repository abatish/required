= Required, a utility to require all files in a directory

Required provides the ability to *require* all files within a <b>d</b>irectory,
with an option for recursive descent. An array of all the files that were loaded
for the first time are returned.

== Quick start

In your code, simply:

    require 'required'
    required "/path/to/dir"
    required ["dir-1", "dir-2", "dir-3"]

Or to recurse into subdirectories to require all files:

    require 'required'
    required "/path/to/dir", true

== Installing with RubyGems

A Gem of Required is available at gemcutter.org.  You can install it with:

    gem install required

== Running the tests

Testing Required requires the shoulda testing framework:

    gem install shoulda

There is one rake-based test task:

    rake test       runs all the tests

== Thanks

I would like to thank Ryan Wilcox for coming up with the initial idea and
implementation of a convenience method for requiring everything in a directory
for a project we work on.
